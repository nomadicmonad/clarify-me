Front-end nodejs/React/Polymer PWA app for well-being analytics tracking.

The core app is built using <a href="https://pwa-starter-kit.polymer-project.org/overview">this</a> framework.

The idea is to allow users to track conditions (e.g. allergies, mood),
and log possible symptoms (e.g. certain foods, events) and the
app will use Bayesian statistics and other techniques to detect
the most likely cause for a given condition.

Work in progress!
